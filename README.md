## 📌 Project Overview

**TensorFlow Playground** (also known as *Deep Playground*) is a browser-based, interactive visualization tool for understanding how neural networks learn. You can configure layers, neurons, activation functions, learning rates, and datasets — all in real time, directly in your browser.

It was built to make neural networks more approachable and intuitive for learners and practitioners alike, with zero setup required.

> 🎯 **Goal:** Demystify neural networks through live, interactive experimentation — no code needed.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is **not an official Google product**. It is an open-source project maintained by the community under the Apache 2.0 License.

## ✨ Features

- 🔵🟠 **Color-coded weights & activations** — orange = negative, blue = positive
- 🧩 **Configurable architecture** — add/remove layers and neurons on the fly
- ⚙️ **Tunable hyperparameters** — learning rate, regularization, activation functions
- 📊 **Multiple datasets** — circle, XOR, Gaussian, spiral
- 🔁 **Real-time training loop** — watch the decision boundary evolve epoch by epoch
- 🔗 **Shareable URLs** — save your exact configuration and share it

---

## 🔄 How It Works

```
Select Dataset → Configure Architecture → Set Hyperparameters → Train → Observe Decision Boundary
```

1️⃣ **Dataset Selection** — Choose from 4 toy datasets (Circle, XOR, Gaussian, Spiral) with adjustable noise and train/test split.

2️⃣ **Network Architecture** — Drag to add/remove hidden layers and neurons. Choose input features (X₁, X₂, X₁², X₂², X₁X₂, sin(X₁), sin(X₂)).

3️⃣ **Hyperparameter Config** — Set learning rate, activation function (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid, Linear), regularization type (L1/L2) and rate.

4️⃣ **Training** — Hit ▶ to start. Weights update in real time using backpropagation. The output plane visualizes the learned decision boundary live.

5️⃣ **Evaluation** — Monitor train loss and test loss as training progresses. Experiment to see how overfitting and underfitting look in practice.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 14.x
- npm

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/playground.git
cd playground

# 1. Install dependencies
npm i

# 2. Compile the app into the dist/ directory
npm run build

# 3. Serve from dist/ and open in browser
npm run serve
```

### ⚡ Fast Dev Mode (Hot Reload)

For a faster edit-refresh cycle during development:

```bash
npm run serve-watch
```

This starts an HTTP server and **automatically re-compiles** TypeScript, HTML, and CSS files on every save — no manual rebuild needed.

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### 🚢 For Owners — Push to Production

```bash
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

This deploys the compiled `dist/` directory directly to GitHub Pages.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Forward propagation** — how inputs flow through layers to produce a prediction
- **Backpropagation** — how gradients flow backward to update weights
- **Activation functions** — how ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid affect learning dynamics
- **Regularization** — L1 vs L2 and their effect on weight magnitude and sparsity
- **Overfitting** — visible when test loss diverges from train loss
- **Feature engineering** — how non-linear input features help separate complex boundaries
- **Learning rate sensitivity** — too high = divergence, too low = slow convergence
